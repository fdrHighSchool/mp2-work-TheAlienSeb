# String Puzzles
#### Respond to the following:

1. *In your own words*, discuss what each String method does:
  * `.substring(a)`
    * **YOUR WRITING HERE**
    this pulls a line from the point at wich a starts until the end of the string

  * `.substring(a, b)`
    * **YOUR WRITING HERE**
    this pulls a part of the string starting at a until b but not including b

  * `.indexOf(str)`
    * **YOUR WRITING HERE**
    this give the index where the first letter of the matching string is found

  * `.equals(str)`
    * **YOUR WRITING HERE**
is a way to see if two strings are equivalent

2. *In your own words*, discuss what the following `for` loop accomplishes for `String s`:
```
for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
      // DO STUFF
}
```
  * **YOUR WRITING HERE**
it allows the function of the for loop to run however long the actual length of the string is
